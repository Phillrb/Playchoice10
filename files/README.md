# files directory

Drop in source '.bin' files produced by the NO$NES assembler assembling '.a22' files.
A sample 'BALLOON_FIGHT.BIN' is included.

Also drop in original Playchoice ROMs that match hosting carts. 
No example is included but 'pc_golf.zip' was used for the example.

Example '.a22' files are in the 'a22' directory.

If you're trying to make copies of existing game info from MAME (or from MAME screenshots) you will be seeing inverted colors on the top screen. Here's a cheat-sheet to convert MAME color to '.A22' color:

* MAME Yellow = .A22 Red
* MAME Blue = .A22 Orange
* MAME Red = .A22 Yellow
* MAME Mint = .A22 Mint
* MAME Green = .A22 Green
